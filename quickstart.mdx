## Welcome to Radical Whale!

This quickstart guide will help you set up your first workspace, import data, create an AI agent, and process your first dataset. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Radical Whale account ([sign up here](https://radicalwhale.com/signup))
- A CSV file with data you'd like to process (optional - we'll provide sample data)
- An OpenAI API key (for AI agent functionality)

## Step 1: Create Your Workspace

After logging in, you'll be guided through workspace creation:

1. **Choose a Workspace Name**: Pick a descriptive name for your team's workspace
2. **Add Description**: Briefly describe what you'll use this workspace for
3. **Select Plan**: Choose the plan that fits your needs (you can start with the free tier)
4. **Invite Team Members**: Add your colleagues' email addresses (optional)

<Tip>
  Workspaces are isolated environments where your team's data, agents, and tools
  are organized. Everything within a workspace is shared among team members
  based on their roles.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Set Up Your API Keys

Before creating agents, you'll need to configure your API keys:

1. Navigate to **Variables** section in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Variable**
3. Set up an OpenAI API key:
   - **Name**: `OpenAI API Key`
   - **Type**: `Secret`
   - **Value**: Your OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-`)

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure! They're encrypted and only visible to workspace
  members who need them.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Import Your First Dataset

Now let's get some data into Radical Whale:

1. Click **Datasets** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Dataset**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: "Sample Customer Data"
   - **Description**: "Customer information for processing"
4. Click **Create Dataset**
5. On the dataset page, click **Import CSV**
6. Upload your CSV file or use our sample customer data

### Sample Data

If you don't have a CSV file ready, you can use this sample data:

```csv
company_name,website,description
Acme Corp,https://acme.com,Manufacturing company
TechStart Inc,https://techstart.io,Software startup
Global Solutions,https://globalsolutions.net,Consulting firm
```

## Step 4: Configure Dataset Columns

After importing, you'll see your data organized into columns. Let's configure them for AI processing:

1. Click on a column header (e.g., "company_name")
2. Click **Edit Column**
3. Configure the column:
   - **Data Type**: Choose the appropriate type (text, number, etc.)
   - **Instructions**: Tell the AI what to do with this column
   - **Agent Assignment**: We'll do this in the next step

## Step 5: Create Your First AI Agent

Now let's create an AI agent to process your data:

1. Click **Agents** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Agent**
3. Configure your agent:

   - **Name**: "Company Enrichment Agent"
   - **Description**: "Enriches company data with additional information"
   - **Model**: Select "gpt-4" (or your preferred model)
   - **API Key Variable**: Select the OpenAI key you created earlier
   - **System Prompt**:
     ```
     You are a company research assistant. When given company information, you provide accurate and helpful insights about the company, including industry, size, and other relevant details. Always be factual and concise.
     ```

4. Click **Create Agent**

## Step 6: Assign Agent to Dataset Column

Let's connect your agent to a dataset column:

1. Go back to your **Datasets** and open your sample dataset
2. Click on a column you want to process (e.g., "description")
3. Click **Edit Column**
4. In the **Agent** dropdown, select "Company Enrichment Agent"
5. Add instructions like: "Analyze this company description and provide insights about their industry and business model"
6. Click **Save**

## Step 7: Process Your Data

Now for the exciting part - let your AI agent process the data:

1. Select the rows you want to process (or select all)
2. Click **Process Selected** or the process button for your column
3. Watch as your agent analyzes each company and provides insights

<Info>
  Processing time depends on the amount of data and the complexity of your
  agent's tasks. You can monitor progress in real-time.
</Info>

## Step 8: Review Results

Once processing is complete:

1. View the enriched data in your dataset
2. Export the results as CSV if needed
3. Review the agent's work and adjust prompts if necessary

## Step 9: Create Your First Page

Now let's document your work using Pages:

1. Click **Pages** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Page**
3. Add a title like "Company Research Notes"
4. Choose an emoji icon (e.g., üìä or üìù)
5. Start writing in the editor

### Try AI Content Generation

1. Type `/ai` at the beginning of a line
2. Select your "Company Enrichment Agent"
3. Optionally attach reference pages for context
4. Write a prompt like: "Write a summary of our company research findings"
5. Click **Generate** and watch AI create content for you

<Tip>
  Pages can be created at the workspace level for general documentation, or
  attached to specific dataset records for contextual notes and analysis.
