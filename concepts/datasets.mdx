## What are Datasets?

Datasets are the heart of your data work in Radical Whale - intelligent data tables where each row becomes a rich record and every cell can be enhanced by AI. Unlike traditional spreadsheets, datasets combine structured data storage with powerful AI-driven research and analysis capabilities.

Think of a dataset as a smart table where your raw data comes alive through AI agents that can research, validate, enrich, and analyze information automatically.

## Core Components

### Datasets - The Foundation

Each dataset is a complete data environment containing:

- **Smart Structure**: Flexible schema that adapts to your data needs
- **Metadata**: Rich information about creation, ownership, and usage
- **Real-time Processing**: Live updates as AI agents work on your data
- **Team Collaboration**: Share and work together on data analysis
- **Export Capabilities**: Download processed data as CSV for external use

### Records - Individual Data Points

Each row in your dataset becomes a detailed record featuring:

- **Expandable Views**: Click any record to see detailed information
- **Rich Pages**: Create documentation, notes, and analysis for specific records
- **Processing History**: Track how data has changed over time
- **Cross-references**: Link related records and build relationships

### Columns - Intelligent Fields

Columns define both structure and behavior:

- **Data Types**: Short text, long text, numbers, dates, URLs, checkboxes, and selects
- **AI Instructions**: Guide agents on how to research and fill data
- **Agent Assignment**: Assign specific AI agents to process column data
- **Validation Rules**: Ensure data quality and consistency
- **Batch Operations**: Process all cells in a column simultaneously

### Cells - The Data Points

Individual data cells offer sophisticated capabilities:

- **Smart Values**: Store structured data with metadata
- **AI Evidence**: See reasoning and sources behind AI-generated values
- **Processing Status**: Track queued, processing, completed, and error states
- **Manual Override**: Edit values directly when needed
- **Source Tracking**: View original sources for research-based data

## Supported Data Types

Radical Whale provides specialized data types optimized for different use cases:

### Text Fields

## AI-Powered Data Processing

### Intelligent Cell Processing

Each cell can be enhanced by AI agents through sophisticated processing:

**Individual Cell Research**

- Click the research button on any cell to queue it for AI processing
- Agents analyze context from other columns to inform their research
- Results include the found value plus supporting evidence and sources

**Batch Processing Operations**

- **Run All**: Process every cell in a column regardless of existing values
- **Run Missing**: Only process empty or incomplete cells
- **Queue Selected Rows**: Process multiple records simultaneously
- **Background Processing**: All AI work happens asynchronously without blocking your workflow

### Processing States

Every cell maintains a clear status throughout its lifecycle:

- **Empty**: No value or processing attempt yet
- **Queued**: Waiting in line for AI processing
- **Processing**: Currently being analyzed by an AI agent
- **Completed**: Successfully processed with results
- **Error**: Processing failed with detailed error information

### Evidence and Sources

AI-processed cells provide rich context:

- **Reasoning**: Detailed explanation of how the AI arrived at the result
- **Source Links**: Original web sources with favicons and previews
- **Confidence Indicators**: Understanding of result reliability
- **Manual Override**: Edit AI results when needed

## Advanced Features

### Record Detail Views

Each record can be explored in depth:

- **Field Overview**: See all column values and their processing status
- **Evidence Browser**: Review AI reasoning and sources for each field
- **Search and Filter**: Find specific information within a record
- **Related Data**: View connections and relationships

### Notebook Pages

Create rich documentation for individual records:

- **Markdown Editor**: Write detailed analysis, notes, and observations
- **Multiple Pages**: Organize different aspects of analysis separately
- **Version History**: Track changes and updates over time
- **Team Collaboration**: Share insights and findings with workspace members

### Filtering and Search

Find exactly what you need:

- **Column-based Filters**: Filter data by any column type
- **Text Search**: Search across all fields simultaneously
- **Status Filters**: Show only processed, pending, or error records
- **Creator Filters**: View datasets by specific team members

### Data Management

Keep your datasets organized and efficient:

- **Favorites**: Mark frequently used datasets for quick access
- **Bulk Operations**: Delete, process, or update multiple records at once
- **Export**: Download complete datasets or filtered views as CSV
- **Sorting**: Order data by any column with persistent sort preferences

## Chat-Driven Data Operations

### Conversational Data Management

Work with your datasets through natural conversation:

- **Agent Chat Interface**: Talk directly with AI agents about your data
- **Column Creation**: Describe new fields and let AI create appropriate columns
- **Record Addition**: Add new data through conversational prompts
- **Data Analysis**: Ask questions about patterns and insights in your data

The chat interface understands your dataset context and can perform complex operations through simple conversations, making data management more intuitive and accessible.
