## What are Agents?

Agents are intelligent AI assistants that bring your data to life in Radical Whale. Each agent combines a powerful language model (like GPT-4 or Claude) with custom instructions, specialized tools, and secure API access to automatically process data, conduct research, and engage in meaningful conversations about your work.

Unlike simple chatbots, agents in Radical Whale are workspace-aware, tool-enabled, and designed for both data processing and interactive collaboration.

## Core Components

### AI Model Configuration

Every agent is powered by a language model:

- **Model Selection**: Choose from GPT-4o, Claude Opus, and other cutting-edge models
- **API Key Management**: Secure credential storage through workspace variables
- **Performance Optimization**: Automatic optimization for speed, accuracy, and cost
- **Multi-Provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, and future model providers

### System Prompts

The system prompt defines your agent's personality, expertise, and behavior:

- **Role Definition**: Establish the agent as a research analyst, data processor, or domain expert
- **Task Instructions**: Specific guidance on how to approach problems and process information
- **Output Requirements**: Structure and format specifications for responses
- **Behavioral Guidelines**: How to handle uncertainty, cite sources, and maintain consistency

### Tool Integration

Agents can be equipped with specialized tools to extend their capabilities beyond their base AI model, enabling access to external APIs, databases, and custom integrations for enhanced data processing and research.

### Chat Interface

Every agent provides an interactive chat experience:

- **Real-time Conversations**: Discuss your data, ask questions, and receive insights
- **Tool Usage Visibility**: See when agents use tools and review their reasoning
- **Context Awareness**: Agents understand your workspace, datasets, and ongoing projects
- **Streaming Responses**: Live updates as agents work through complex problems

## How Agents Work

### Dataset Processing

Agents can be assigned to specific dataset columns to automatically process data:

**Column Assignment**

- Assign agents to individual columns in your datasets
- Each column can have its own processing instructions
- Agents understand context from other columns to inform their work
- Process data individually or in batches across entire columns

**Processing Workflow**

- **Individual Processing**: Click the research button on any cell to queue it for processing
- **Batch Operations**: Process entire columns with "Run All" or "Run Missing" commands
- **Background Processing**: All work happens asynchronously without blocking your workflow
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor queued, processing, completed, and error states in real-time

**Evidence and Sources**

- Agents provide detailed reasoning for their results
- Source links and references for research-based findings
- Confidence indicators and uncertainty acknowledgment
- Manual override capabilities when needed

### Interactive Chat

Beyond data processing, agents serve as knowledgeable collaborators:

**Workspace Awareness**

- Understand your datasets, tools, and ongoing projects
- Access to workspace context for informed conversations
- Ability to help create new columns, records, and structures
- Integration with your existing data and workflows

**Tool-Enhanced Conversations**
