## What are Agents?

Agents are AI assistants that combine language models (GPT-4o, Claude) with custom instructions, tools, and API access to automatically process data and engage in conversations about your work.

Unlike simple chatbots, agents are workspace-aware, tool-enabled, and designed for both data processing and interactive collaboration.

## Core Components

**AI Model**: Choose from OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini) or Anthropic (Claude Opus, Sonnet, Haiku). API keys stored securely in workspace variables.

**System Prompt**: Defines agent personality, expertise, and behavior. Includes role definition, task instructions, output requirements, and behavioral guidelines.

**Tools**: Web search, APIs, databases, and custom integrations that extend agent capabilities beyond the base AI model.

**Chat Interface**: Real-time conversations with context awareness, tool usage visibility, and streaming responses.

## How Agents Work

### Dataset Processing

Assign agents to dataset columns to automatically process data:

- **Column assignment**: Each column can have its own processing instructions
- **Individual processing**: Click research button on any cell to queue it
- **Batch operations**: Process entire columns with "Run All" or "Run Missing"
- **Background processing**: All work happens asynchronously without blocking workflow
- **Evidence tracking**: AI provides detailed reasoning, sources, and confidence indicators

### Interactive Chat

Agents serve as knowledgeable collaborators:

- Understand datasets, tools, and ongoing projects
- Use connected tools during conversations
- Help with data analysis, planning, and decision-making
- Transparent tool usage with real-time execution

## Creating Agents

1. Name and description
2. Select AI model and configure API key
3. Write system prompt defining role and behavior
4. Select relevant tools from workspace library
5. Test in chat interface before deploying

**Prompt engineering tips**: Clear role definition, specific task instructions, output format requirements, error handling guidelines.

## Management

**Agent dashboard**: View all agents with status, model, and activity. Search, filter, edit, duplicate, and test agents.

**Team collaboration**: Agents available to all workspace members with shared context and institutional knowledge.

**Performance monitoring**: Track processing states, tool usage, response times, success rates, and API consumption.

## Best Practices

**Model selection**: Use GPT-4o/Claude Opus for complex reasoning, GPT-4o Mini for straightforward tasks. Consider cost vs performance.

**Tool management**: Start with essential tools, add gradually, monitor usage patterns and effectiveness.

**Security**: Use workspace variables for API keys, monitor tool availability, regular testing of integrations.

## Common Use Cases

**Business intelligence**: Research companies, enrich contact lists, analyze competitive landscapes, track funding and acquisitions.

**Data processing**: Fill missing information, standardize formats, cross-reference sources, validate accuracy.

**Customer management**: Score leads, research prospects, gather contact information, analyze support tickets.

**Content creation**: Research assistance, knowledge base development, summarization, best practices documentation.

## Core Components

## How Agents Work

### Dataset Processing

Agents can be assigned to specific dataset columns to automatically process data:

**Column Assignment**

- Assign agents to individual columns in your datasets
- Each column can have its own processing instructions
- Agents understand context from other columns to inform their work
- Process data individually or in batches across entire columns

**Processing Workflow**

- **Individual Processing**: Click the research button on any cell to queue it for processing
- **Batch Operations**: Process entire columns with "Run All" or "Run Missing" commands
- **Background Processing**: All work happens asynchronously without blocking your workflow
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor queued, processing, completed, and error states in real-time

**Evidence and Sources**

- Agents provide detailed reasoning for their results
- Source links and references for research-based findings
- Confidence indicators and uncertainty acknowledgment
- Manual override capabilities when needed

### Interactive Chat

Beyond data processing, agents serve as knowledgeable collaborators:

**Workspace Awareness**

- Understand your datasets, tools, and ongoing projects
- Access to workspace context for informed conversations
- Ability to help create new columns, records, and structures
- Integration with your existing data and workflows

**Tool-Enhanced Conversations**

- Use connected tools during chat conversations
- Research information, verify facts, and gather current data
- Transparent tool usage with expandable details
- Real-time tool execution with status updates

**Collaborative Features**

- Copy and share conversation results
- Build on previous interactions and context
- Help with data analysis, planning, and decision-making
- Support for both quick questions and deep exploration

## Creating and Configuring Agents

### Basic Information

Start with clear identification:

- **Name**: Descriptive names like "Company Research Agent" or "Document Analyzer"
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the agent's purpose and capabilities
- **Status**: Active or inactive state for workspace management

### Model Configuration

Select and configure the AI model:

**Model Selection**
Choose from available model providers:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, GPT-4.1 series, GPT-5 series
- **Anthropic**: Claude Opus 4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.0, Claude Haiku variants
- **Future Models**: System designed to support new model releases

**API Key Setup**

- Use workspace variables for secure credential storage
- Never paste API keys directly into agent configuration
- Automatic validation of API key functionality
- Support for multiple API keys across different providers

### System Prompt Engineering

Craft effective instructions for your agent:

**Role Definition**

```
You are a professional business research analyst specializing in
company intelligence and market research.
```

**Task Instructions**

```
When provided with company information, your task is to:
1. Research and analyze the company's core business
2. Determine the primary industry and market sector
3. Estimate company size and maturity level
4. Identify key products or services offered
5. Assess market position and competitive landscape
```

**Output Format**

```
Provide your analysis in JSON format:
{
  "industry": "Primary industry classification",
  "company_size": "Estimated size (Startup, Small, Medium, Large)",
  "primary_products": ["List of main products/services"],
  "confidence_score": 0.85
}
```

### Tool Selection

Enhance agent capabilities with tools:

- Select relevant tools from your workspace tool library
- Tools are filtered and searchable by name, type, and description
- Monitor tool usage and performance in chat conversations
