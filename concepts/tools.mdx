## What are Tools?

Tools enable agents to access external APIs, services, and data sources, going beyond conversation to retrieve real-time information, perform actions, and integrate with existing systems.

## API Request Tools

Configure HTTP requests to any external API:

**Configuration**: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), request URL with variable substitution, headers (including auth), query parameters, request body (JSON), input schema (JSON Schema format).

**Input schema example**:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "search_query": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The search term"
    },
    "max_results": {
      "type": "integer",
      "default": 10
    }
  },
  "required": ["search_query"]
}
```

**Variable substitution**: Use schema variables in URLs (`https://api.example.com/search?q={{search_query}}`), headers (`Authorization: Bearer {{api_token}}`), and request bodies.

## Tool Testing

Built-in testing capabilities: Schema validation with sample data, API testing to verify connectivity, response preview before deployment, error debugging.

## Managing Tools

Tools dashboard for creating new tools, editing configurations, testing functionality, and organizing your tool library with search and filtering.

## Agent Integration

Assign tools to agents → Agents discover capabilities automatically → Agents choose when and how to use tools → Tool results seamlessly incorporated into responses.

## MCP Server Tools

Model Context Protocol support for dynamic tool discovery, server connections, standardized protocols, popular integrations (Tavily Search, GitHub, Slack, Google Drive).
