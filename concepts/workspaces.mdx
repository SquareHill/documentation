## What are Workspaces?

Workspaces are isolated environments that contain all your team's resources: datasets, agents, tools, and variables. Think of a workspace as your team's dedicated area where you can collaborate on data processing projects while keeping everything organized and secure.

## Key Features

### Team Collaboration

- **Role-based Access**: Control who can view, edit, or manage workspace resources
- **Member Management**: Invite team members and assign appropriate roles
- **Shared Resources**: All workspace members have access to shared datasets, agents, and tools

### Resource Organization

- **Centralized Assets**: All your datasets, agents, tools, and variables in one place
- **Cross-resource Relationships**: Agents can use workspace tools, variables store shared credentials
- **Project Isolation**: Keep different projects or clients in separate workspaces

### Security & Permissions

- **Data Isolation**: Workspace data is completely isolated from other workspaces
- **Encrypted Variables**: API keys and sensitive data are encrypted and access-controlled
- **Audit Trail**: Track who accessed what and when (coming soon)

## Workspace Roles

- **Member Management**: Can invite, remove, and change roles of all members
- **Billing Management**: Manage subscription and billing settings
- **Workspace Settings**: Can modify workspace settings and delete the workspace

### Admin

### Member

## Best Practices

### Workspace Organization

- **Purpose-focused**: Create workspaces for specific projects or teams
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names that indicate workspace purpose
- **Regular Cleanup**: Archive or delete unused resources periodically

### Team Management

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Give members the minimum access they need
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review member access and roles
- **Onboarding Process**: Have a clear process for adding new team members

### Security

- **API Key Management**: Use workspace variables for all API keys
- **Access Monitoring**: Regularly review who has access to sensitive resources
- **Data Classification**: Understand what data is stored and its sensitivity level

## Common Use Cases

### Development Teams

- **Separate Environments**: Dev, staging, and production workspaces
- **Feature Development**: Isolate experimental features in separate workspaces
- **Code Review**: Use workspaces for collaborative review of data processing workflows

### Client Services

- **Client Isolation**: Separate workspace for each client
- **Project Management**: Organize client work by project or engagement
- **Access Control**: Give clients access only to their relevant workspace

### Research Teams

- **Project-based**: One workspace per research project
- **Collaboration**: Share datasets and analysis tools across team members
- **Publication**: Prepare and organize data for publication or sharing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Can't see expected resources**

- Verify you're in the correct workspace
- Check your role permissions
- Confirm resources weren't moved or deleted

**Invitation emails not received**

- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify email address is correct
- Contact workspace admin to resend invitation

**Billing or plan issues**

- Review current usage against plan limits
