## What are Workspaces?

Workspaces are the foundation of your Radical Whale experience - isolated environments that contain all your team's resources including datasets, agents, tools, variables, and processing machines. Each workspace acts as a complete data collaboration environment where teams can work together on projects while maintaining security and organization.

Think of a workspace as your team's digital headquarters for data work, where everything from structured datasets to AI agents and custom workflows lives together in one organized, secure space.

- Limited workspace settings access

**Member**

- Access and use existing workspace resources
- Create new resources with standard permissions
- View and use variables (read-only access)
- Collaborate on datasets and workflows

### Workspace Switching

Easily switch between multiple workspaces using the workspace switcher in the sidebar. Each workspace maintains its own:

- Complete resource isolation
- Independent billing and settings
- Separate team members and permissions
- Dedicated processing queues and machines

### Invitation System

- **Email Invitations**: Send secure invitations to team members
- **Role Assignment**: Set specific roles when inviting new members
- **Expiration Management**: Invitations expire automatically for security
- **Pending Invite Tracking**: Monitor outstanding invitations in the members page

## Workspace Management

### Creating Workspaces

The workspace creation process guides you through:

1. **Basic Setup**: Name and description for your workspace
2. **Plan Selection**: Choose from Free, Starter, or Pro plans based on your needs
3. **Team Invitations**: Optionally invite team members during setup
4. **Final Configuration**: Complete setup and start collaborating

### Workspace Settings
