The Record Detail page provides a comprehensive view of individual dataset records, combining structured data visualization with powerful notebook-style documentation capabilities. Each record becomes a canvas for rich analysis, notes, and AI-generated insights.

## Overview

When you click on any record in your dataset, you enter a dedicated workspace that offers two complementary views:

- **Properties Tab**: Structured view of all field values with evidence and sources
- **Notebook Tab**: Rich text editor for creating documentation pages with AI assistance

This dual approach allows you to see both the raw data and create meaningful documentation around specific records.
