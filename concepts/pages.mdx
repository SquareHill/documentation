## What are Pages?

Pages are rich-text notebooks built with a powerful editor that enables you to create, organize, and collaborate on documentation across your workspace. Whether you're writing project documentation, analyzing data, or letting AI generate content, pages provide a flexible canvas for knowledge management.

Think of pages as intelligent documents that can be created at the workspace level for general knowledge or attached to specific dataset records for contextual analysis and notes.

## Core Concepts

### Workspace-Level Pages

Workspace pages serve as your team's knowledge hub:

- **Shared Documentation**: Create docs, wikis, and knowledge bases accessible to all workspace members
- **Project Planning**: Draft project plans, roadmaps, and strategic documents
- **Meeting Notes**: Capture discussions, decisions, and action items
- **Templates**: Build reusable templates for reports, analyses, and standard documents
- **Reference Material**: Store policies, procedures, and institutional knowledge

### Record-Level Pages

Record pages provide context-specific documentation:

- **Data Analysis**: Write detailed analysis for individual dataset records
- **Research Notes**: Document findings and insights for specific companies, people, or entities
- **Case Studies**: Create in-depth examination of particular records
- **Processing Context**: Explain data decisions and enrichment reasoning
- **Historical Documentation**: Track changes, updates, and evolution over time

### Rich Text Editor

Pages are built with Tiptap, a modern editor offering:

- **Markdown Support**: Write using familiar markdown syntax
- **Formatting Options**: Bold, italic, headings, lists, and more
- **Code Blocks**: Syntax-highlighted code with language selection
- **Tables**: Create structured data tables within your pages
- **Images**: Embed images directly in your documentation
- **Links**: Connect to external resources and other pages
- **Task Lists**: Interactive checkboxes for action items
- **Horizontal Rules**: Visual section dividers

## Creating and Managing Pages

### Page Creation

Creating a page is straightforward:

**Workspace Pages**

1. Navigate to the Pages section in your workspace sidebar
2. Click "Create Page" to start a new document
3. Enter a title and optional emoji icon
4. Start writing with the rich text editor
5. Save automatically as you type

**Record Pages**

1. Open any dataset record detail view
2. Navigate to the Pages tab
3. Click "Create Page" to add documentation
4. The page is automatically linked to that specific record
5. Access context from the parent dataset record

### Page Metadata

Every page includes:

- **Title**: Descriptive name for the page
- **Emoji/Icon**: Visual identifier using emojis or Lucide icons
- **Status**: Draft, published, or archived state
- **Tags**: Categorization labels for organization
- **Timestamps**: Creation and last updated information
- **Author**: Creator and contributor tracking

### Organization Features

Keep your pages organized:

- **Search**: Full-text search across all page content
- **Filtering**: Filter by status, tags, author, or creation date
- **Sorting**: Order by title, updated date, or creation date
- **Favorites**: Star important pages for quick access
- **Breadcrumbs**: Navigate page hierarchies and relationships

## AI-Powered Content Generation

### Inline AI Assistant

The most powerful feature of pages is the integrated AI assistant:

**Slash Commands**

Type `/` at the beginning of any line to access:

- **AI Generation**: `/ai` - Generate content using your workspace agents
- **Headings**: `/h1`, `/h2`, `/h3` - Create section headers
- **Lists**: `/bullet`, `/numbered`, `/todo` - Create various list types
- **Code**: `/code` - Insert code blocks with syntax highlighting
- **Tables**: `/table` - Insert structured data tables
- **Media**: `/image`, `/divider` - Add visual elements

**AI Content Generation**

When you invoke `/ai`, you get:

1. **Agent Selection**: Choose from your workspace agents
2. **Page Context**: Optionally attach reference pages for context
3. **Prompt Input**: Describe what content you want generated
4. **Real-time Streaming**: Watch as AI generates content live
5. **Tool Usage**: See when AI uses tools for research
6. **Markdown Output**: Content inserted as formatted markdown

### Reference Pages as Context

One of the most powerful features is attaching pages as context:

**How It Works**

- Select pages from your workspace to provide as reference material
- AI agents can access the full content of selected pages
- Use pages as templates, style guides, or information sources
- Combine multiple pages for comprehensive context

**Use Cases**

- **Template Copying**: Reference a well-formatted page to generate similar content
- **Style Consistency**: Attach your style guide for consistent voice and tone
- **Data Context**: Include pages with background information or research
- **Format Replication**: Use existing pages as structural templates
