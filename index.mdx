## What is Radical Whale?

Radical Whale is an AI-powered platform for working with structured data and intelligent agents, combining flexible data tables with AI-driven automation, analysis, and rich documentation.

## Key Features

## How It Works

Radical Whale operates on five core concepts that work together:

### 1. Workspaces

Your team's dedicated environment where all resources are organized. Each workspace has its own datasets, agents, tools, pages, and team members with specific roles and permissions.

### 2. Datasets

Structured data tables with intelligent columns. Import CSV files, define column types and AI processing instructions, and let agents enrich your data automatically.

### 3. Agents

AI-powered assistants configured with specific models (GPT-4o, Claude), system prompts, and access to tools. Agents process dataset columns and power interactive chat conversations.

### 4. Tools

Custom integrations that extend agent capabilities. Create API tools for REST endpoints or connect MCP servers for dynamic tool discovery.

### 5. Pages

Rich documentation with AI content generation. Create workspace pages for team knowledge or record pages for contextual analysis with page context for consistent output.
