## How It Works

Radical Whale operates on four core concepts that work together to create powerful data processing workflows:

### 1. Workspaces

Your team's dedicated environment where all resources are organized. Each workspace has its own datasets, agents, tools, and team members with specific roles and permissions.

### 2. Datasets

Structured collections of data with defined columns and records. Import CSV files, define column types and instructions, and let AI agents process and enrich your data.

### 3. Agents

AI-powered processors configured with specific models (like GPT-4), system prompts, and access to custom tools. Agents can be assigned to dataset columns to automatically process and extract information.

### 4. Tools

Custom integrations that extend agent capabilities. Create API tools to connect with external services, databases, or any REST endpoint your agents need to access.

## Use Cases

**Document Processing**: Extract structured data from invoices, contracts, resumes, and other documents.

**Data Enrichment**: Enhance existing datasets with additional information from APIs, web scraping, or AI analysis.

**Research Automation**: Gather and synthesize information from multiple sources automatically.

**Content Analysis**: Analyze text, sentiment, topics, and trends across large datasets.

**API Integration**: Connect your data processing workflows with external services and databases.
