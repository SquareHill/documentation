## Viewing Records

Your dataset displays in a spreadsheet-like grid. Use pagination, sorting, and filtering to navigate large datasets.

**View Modes**: Table view (default), Card view (detailed single records), List view (compact mobile-friendly)

**Selection**: Click rows to select, Ctrl/Cmd+Click for multiple, Shift+Click for ranges

## Editing Records

**Inline Editing**: Double-click any cell, edit, press Enter to save or Escape to cancel.

**Form Editing**: Click **Edit Record** for dedicated form with all fields. Best for comprehensive updates.

**Bulk Editing**: Select multiple records → Apply changes to all:

- Find and Replace across selected records
- Set same value for all selected records
- Clear values from selected records
- Apply formulas to calculate new values

<Warning>
  Preview bulk changes before applying. Bulk edits support undo.
</Warning>

## Filtering and Search

**Quick Search**: Search across all visible columns or within specific columns. Use quotes for exact matches.

**Advanced Filters**:

- **Text**: Contains, Starts with, Ends with, Equals, Is empty
- **Number**: Equals, Greater than, Less than, Between ranges
- **Date**: Before, After, Between, Relative dates (last 30 days, this month)
- **Boolean**: True/False values

Combine filters with AND/OR/NOT logic. Save frequently used filter combinations.

**Sorting**: Click column headers to sort. Hold Shift to sort by multiple columns.

## Creating and Deleting Records
