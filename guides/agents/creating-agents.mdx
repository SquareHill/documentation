task is to:

1. Research and analyze the company's core business
2. Determine the primary industry and market sector
3. Estimate company size and maturity level
4. Identify key products or services offered
5. Assess market position and competitive landscape
```

#### Output Format

Specify exactly how results should be formatted:

```
Provide your analysis in JSON format:
{
  "industry": "Primary industry classification",
  "sector": "Market sector (B2B, B2C, etc.)",
  "company_size": "Estimated size (Startup, Small, Medium, Large, Enterprise)",
  "primary_products": ["List of main products/services"],
  "market_position": "Brief assessment of market position",
  "confidence_score": 0.85
}
```

#### Guidelines and Constraints

Add important guidelines:

```
Guidelines:
- Always be factual and cite sources when possible
- If information is uncertain, indicate confidence level
- Focus on publicly available information
- Avoid speculation or assumptions
- If you cannot find sufficient information, clearly state this
```
