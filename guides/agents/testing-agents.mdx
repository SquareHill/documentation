## Overview

Testing agents is crucial for ensuring reliable, consistent, and accurate behavior before deploying them on important datasets. This guide covers testing methodologies, validation techniques, and best practices for agent quality assurance.

## Testing Methodologies

### Interactive Testing

#### Chat-Based Testing
The most immediate way to test agents is through the chat interface:

1. **Navigate to Agents** in your workspace
2. **Select your agent** and click "Start Chat"
3. **Conduct conversations** that simulate real-world scenarios
4. **Observe behavior** including tool usage and response quality
5. **Document results** for comparison and improvement

#### Conversation Scenarios
- **Simple Queries**: Test basic understanding and responses
- **Complex Requests**: Multi-step tasks requiring reasoning
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual inputs or boundary conditions
- **Error Conditions**: Invalid inputs and error handling
- **Context Switching**: Changes in topic or task focus

### Structured Testing

#### Test Case Development
Create systematic test cases that cover:

```json
{
  "test_case": "Company Information Extraction",
  "input": "Extract key information about Apple Inc.",
  "expected_behavior": {
    "tools_used": ["web_search", "company_database"],
    "response_format": "structured_json",
    "required_fields": ["name", "industry", "headquarters", "founded"]
  },
  "success_criteria": {
    "accuracy": "> 95%",
    "completeness": "all required fields present",
    "response_time": "< 30 seconds"
  }
}
```

#### Validation Criteria
- **Accuracy**: Correctness of extracted information
- **Completeness**: Coverage of required data points
- **Consistency**: Similar results for similar inputs
- **Format Adherence**: Proper output structure
- **Performance**: Response time and resource usage

### Automated Testing

#### Batch Testing
Run agents on test datasets to evaluate performance at scale:

1. **Prepare Test Data**: Create representative sample datasets
2. **Define Metrics**: Establish measurable success criteria
3. **Execute Tests**: Run agents on test data
4. **Analyze Results**: Compare outputs against expected results
5. **Generate Reports**: Document findings and recommendations

#### Regression Testing
Ensure changes don't break existing functionality:
- **Baseline Establishment**: Record current performance metrics
- **Change Implementation**: Update agent configuration or prompts
- **Comparison Testing**: Re-run tests and compare results
- **Issue Identification**: Flag any performance degradation
- **Resolution**: Address issues before deployment

## Test Categories

### Functional Testing

#### Core Functionality
- **Task Completion**: Can the agent complete its assigned tasks?
- **Instruction Following**: Does it adhere to system prompt guidelines?
- **Output Format**: Are responses in the expected format?
- **Data Accuracy**: Is extracted information correct?

#### Tool Integration
- **Tool Selection**: Does the agent choose appropriate tools?
- **Parameter Passing**: Are tool parameters correct and complete?
- **Result Processing**: How well does it integrate tool responses?
- **Error Recovery**: How does it handle tool failures?

#### Example Test Cases
```
Test: Web Search Integration
Input: "Find the current stock price of Tesla"
Expected: Uses web search tool, returns current price with timestamp
Validation: Price accuracy, data freshness, proper formatting

Test: Error Handling  
Input: Provide invalid search query to trigger tool error
Expected: Graceful error handling, informative user message
Validation: No crashes, helpful error explanation
```

### Performance Testing

#### Speed and Efficiency
- **Response Time**: How quickly does the agent respond?
- **Tool Usage**: Are tools used efficiently and appropriately?
- **Resource Consumption**: CPU, memory, and API usage
- **Throughput**: How many requests can it handle?

#### Scalability
- **Load Testing**: Performance under high request volumes
- **Concurrent Users**: Behavior with multiple simultaneous users
- **Large Datasets**: Performance on substantial data volumes
- **Resource Scaling**: Behavior as resource availability changes

#### Benchmarking
```
Performance Baseline:
- Simple queries: < 2 seconds
- Complex analysis: < 30 seconds  
- Tool-heavy tasks: < 60 seconds
- Batch processing: 100 records/minute
```

### Quality Testing

#### Output Quality
- **Relevance**: How relevant are responses to the input?
- **Accuracy**: Factual correctness of information
- **Completeness**: Coverage of all requested information
- **Clarity**: How clear and understandable are responses?

#### Consistency Testing
- **Repeated Queries**: Same input should yield consistent results
- **Similar Queries**: Related inputs should have coherent responses
- **Cross-Session**: Consistency across different chat sessions
- **Temporal**: Results should be stable over time (when appropriate)

#### Bias and Fairness
- **Demographic Bias**: Fair treatment across different groups
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Appropriate responses for diverse contexts
- **Language Bias**: Consistent quality across different languages
- **Topic Bias**: Balanced treatment of controversial subjects

## Testing Tools and Techniques

### Manual Testing

#### Exploratory Testing
- **Free-form Interaction**: Open-ended conversations to discover issues
- **Boundary Testing**: Push agents to their limits
- **Creative Input**: Unusual or unexpected query types

class AgentTester:
    def __init__(self, agent_id, test_suite):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.test_suite = test_suite
    
    def run_tests(self):
        results = []
        for test in self.test_suite:
            result = self.execute_test(test)
            results.append(result)
        return self.analyze_results(results)
    
    def execute_test(self, test):
        response = self.send_message(test.input)
        return self.validate_response(response, test.criteria)
```
