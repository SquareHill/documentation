## Model Selection

**GPT-4.1**: Latest flagship, enhanced reasoning. Best for complex analysis and creative tasks.

**GPT-4.1-mini**: Faster, cost-effective. Best for balanced performance and standard processing.

**GPT-4.1-nano**: Ultra-fast, basic operations only. Best for high-throughput simple tasks.

**GPT-5 / GPT-5-mini / GPT-5-nano**: Next-generation models with advanced capabilities.

### Selection Criteria

**Task Complexity**: Use nano/mini for simple extraction, full models for nuanced reasoning.

**Volume and Cost**: High volume = mini/nano to control costs. Critical tasks = invest in full models.

**Response Time**: nano (~500ms), mini (~1-2s), full (~2-4s), GPT-5 (~3-6s).

## API Key Management

Store API keys in workspace variables, never directly in agent configuration. Use separate keys for development and production. Monitor usage and set limits on provider dashboards.

## Cost Management

**Token-Based Pricing**: Input tokens (prompt/context) + Output tokens (response) + Tool tokens.

**Optimization**:

- Write efficient prompts without unnecessary context
- Use appropriate models (don't over-engineer simple tasks)
- Include only necessary tools
- Process records in batches

Monitor API usage through provider dashboards and set billing alerts.
