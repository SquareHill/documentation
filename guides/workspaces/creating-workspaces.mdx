## Overview

Creating a workspace is your first step in Radical Whale. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a new workspace, configuring its settings, and inviting your team members.

## Prerequisites

- A Radical Whale account ([sign up here](https://radicalwhale.com/signup))
- Basic understanding of your team structure and roles
- List of team members to invite (optional)

## Step 1: Access Workspace Creation

### From the Dashboard

1. Log into your Radical Whale account
2. If this is your first workspace, you'll be automatically directed to workspace creation
3. If you have existing workspaces, click the workspace switcher in the top navigation
4. Click **Create New Workspace**

### During Onboarding

New users are guided through workspace creation as part of the onboarding process.

## Step 2: Configure Basic Settings

### Workspace Name

Choose a descriptive name that clearly identifies your workspace:

- **Good examples**: "Marketing Team", "Client Projects - Acme Corp", "Data Science Lab"
- **Avoid**: Generic names like "Workspace 1" or "Test"

### Description (Optional)

Add a brief description explaining the workspace's purpose:

- What type of work will be done in this workspace
- Which team or department it serves
- Any specific goals or projects

<Tip>
  Choose names and descriptions carefully. While you can change them later, a
  clear initial setup helps with team organization.
