## Overview

Page context is one of the most powerful features in Radical Whale - it allows your AI agents to access the full content of other pages as reference material when generating new content. This enables consistent style, template replication, and intelligent content synthesis across your workspace.

Think of it as giving your AI agent a reading list before asking it to write something. The agent can read and understand those pages, then use that knowledge to inform its output.

## How Page Context Works

### The Basic Flow

1. **Invoke AI**: Type `/ai` in any page editor to open the AI prompt
2. **Select Agent**: Choose which AI agent will generate content
3. **Attach Pages**: Click to select one or more reference pages
4. **Write Prompt**: Describe what you want the AI to create
5. **Generate**: AI reads attached pages and generates informed content

### Behind the Scenes

When you attach pages as context:

- Pages become available as dynamic tools for the AI agent
- Each page is converted to a structured tool with its full content
- The AI can "call" these tools to read page content when needed
- Content is provided to the AI in markdown format
- AI uses this information to inform its response

## Selecting Reference Pages

### The Page Selector Interface

When you click "Attach pages" in the AI prompt, you see:

**Workspace Pages**

- All pages created at the workspace level
- Searchable by title for quick finding
- Visual icons/emojis for easy identification
- Select multiple pages for comprehensive context

**Dataset Pages**

- Pages attached to specific dataset records
- Grouped separately for organization
- Can mix workspace and dataset pages
- Context from different sources

### Selection Strategies

**Single Page Reference**

Use one page when you want to:

- Replicate a specific template
- Follow a particular style guide
- Reference detailed methodology
- Base content on one document

**Multiple Page Context**

Attach multiple pages to:

- Synthesize information from various sources
- Compare and contrast different approaches
- Build comprehensive understanding
- Provide diverse examples and context

**Smart Selection Tips**

- More pages = more context but slower generation
- Keep focused on relevant references only
- Group related pages together
- Update selections based on results

## Common Use Cases

  - "Q4 Metrics Dashboard" (Specific)

Prompt: "Write product launch announcement incorporating our brand voice, technical accuracy, and Q4 performance"
```

### Progressive Refinement

Use page context iteratively to refine content:

1. **Initial Generation**: Generate content with basic context
2. **Save as Page**: Save generated content as a new page
3. **Refine with Context**: Attach the generated page plus refinement guides
4. **Regenerate**: Ask AI to improve based on additional context

**Example Flow**:

```
Round 1:
Attached: "Style Guide"
Prompt: "Write blog post about new feature"
→ Save result as "Feature Blog Draft v1"

Round 2:
Attached: "Feature Blog Draft v1", "Top Performing Blog Posts"
Prompt: "Enhance this draft by incorporating elements from our best-performing posts"
→ Improved version with proven engagement patterns
```

### Context Specialization

Match page context to specific generation needs:

**Creative Content**

- Attach creative briefs, brand stories, successful campaigns
- Reference emotional tone and narrative style
- Include visual and sensory descriptions

**Technical Documentation**

- Attach architecture diagrams, API docs, system specs
- Reference code examples and patterns

- **Descriptive Content**: Write clearly and completely
- **Remove Cruft**: Clean up outdated or irrelevant information
- **Add Examples**: Include concrete examples and illustrations
- **Update Regularly**: Keep information current and accurate

**Create Reusable Templates**

Build a library of reference pages:

- **Style Guides**: Writing voice, tone, and formatting standards
- **Templates**: Standard document structures for common needs
- **Examples**: Best-in-class examples of different content types
- **Methodologies**: Processes and approaches to follow
- **Standards**: Technical specifications and requirements

### Prompt Engineering with Context

**Be Explicit About Context Use**

Tell the AI how to use attached pages:

```
Good: "Using the attached style guide, write a blog post that follows our voice and tone guidelines"

Better: "Reference the 'Voice and Tone' section in the attached style guide to match our conversational-yet-professional style when writing this blog post"
```

**Specify What to Extract**

Direct attention to relevant parts:

```
"Focus on the 'Success Metrics' section from the attached research when creating this analysis"

"Use the formatting structure from the template but update all data with current Q4 metrics"
```

**Combine Context and New Information**

Balance reference material with new inputs:

```
Attached: "Product Launch Template"
Prompt: "Use this template to create a launch announcement for our new AI feature. The feature includes: [describe new features]. Target audience is enterprise customers. Key benefits are speed and accuracy."
```

### Quality Control

**Review Generated Content**

Always review AI-generated content that uses page context:

- **Context Accuracy**: Did AI correctly understand the reference material?
- **Appropriate Application**: Was context used in the right way?
- **Completeness**: Are all key points from context incorporated?
- **Original Additions**: Is new information correctly integrated?
- **Style Consistency**: Does output match reference style?

**Iterate When Needed**

If results aren't quite right:

- Adjust prompt to be more specific about context use
- Try different combination of reference pages
- Add more context or remove irrelevant pages
- Provide examples of desired output in prompt

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: AI doesn't seem to reference attached pages**

Solutions:

- Explicitly mention the pages in your prompt
- Use phrases like "Based on the attached pages..." or "Following the template..."
- Verify pages have substantial content (not empty or very short)
- Check that selected pages are relevant to the task

**Issue: Generated content doesn't match template structure**

Solutions:

- Be more explicit: "Follow the exact section structure from the template"
- Provide specific guidance on what to keep vs. change
- Reference specific sections by name
- Consider breaking into smaller, section-by-section generations

**Issue: AI seems overwhelmed by too much context**

Solutions:

- Reduce number of attached pages to most essential ones
- Break task into smaller pieces with focused context
- Summarize pages manually before attaching
- Use more specific prompts that guide attention

**Issue: Content lacks originality, too similar to reference**

Solutions:

- Adjust prompt to request creative interpretation
- Ask for synthesis rather than replication
- Provide new information to incorporate
- Request specific changes or enhancements

### Performance Optimization

**Balance Context and Speed**

More context = slower generation:

- **Quick Tasks**: Use 1-2 focused pages
- **Complex Tasks**: Can use 4-6 comprehensive pages
- **Iterative Work**: Start small, add context as needed
- **Production**: Optimize context set based on testing

**Monitor Token Usage**

Large pages consume more tokens:
