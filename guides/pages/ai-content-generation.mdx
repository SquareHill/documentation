title: "AI Content Generation"
description: "Use AI agents to generate and enhance page content"
---

## Getting Started

Type `/ai` in any page to open the AI prompt interface.

**Steps**:

1. Select your agent from dropdown
2. Attach pages (optional) for reference context
3. Write your prompt describing what you want
4. Click "Generate" or press ⌘/Ctrl+Enter
5. Watch content stream in real-time
6. Review and edit the generated content

## Writing Prompts

Be specific with all key elements:

✅ **Good**: "Write a 500-word developer blog post explaining our new API rate limiting feature. Include Python code examples and target intermediate developers."

❌ **Too vague**: "Write about the API"

**Include**: Content type, topic, audience, style/tone, length, format.

## Page Context

Attach reference pages to inform generation. Click "Attach pages" to select workspace or dataset pages.

**Uses**: Templates (replicate structure), style guides (maintain voice), source material (synthesize information), examples (follow patterns).

Attach 1-3 pages for most tasks. More pages = more context but slower generation.

## Generation Patterns

### Draft from Scratch

```
Prompt: "Write a comprehensive guide to setting up our development environment. Include prerequisites, installation, configuration, and troubleshooting. Target new developers."

Result: Complete first draft to review and refine
```

### Expand Outline

```
Manual: Write section headings
Then: "Expand this outline into full paragraphs with detailed explanations and examples."

Result: Fleshed-out content from your structure
```

### Rewrite with Style

```
Attached: "Brand Voice Guide"
Prompt: "Rewrite this section in our brand voice - more conversational while keeping key information: [paste content]"

Result: Same information, different style
```

### Synthesize Information

```
Attached: "Research Report 1", "Research Report 2"
Prompt: "Create an executive summary synthesizing key insights from these reports. Focus on findings, implications, and recommendations. Under 500 words."

Result: Concise summary combining both sources
```

## Agent Selection

**Content creation**: Agents configured for writing, GPT-4o for complex content
**Research-based**: Agents with web search tools for fact-based content  
**Technical docs**: Agents with technical specifications access
**Marketing**: Agents configured for engaging, benefit-focused writing

Create specialized agents with appropriate system prompts for each content type.

## Review Generated Content

Check for factual accuracy, appropriate tone, completeness, proper formatting, and relevant examples.

**Iterate if needed**: Delete and regenerate with refined prompt, try different page context, consider different agent, or manually edit sections.

## Troubleshooting

**Too generic**: Provide more specific prompts, include examples, attach reference pages

**Wrong tone**: Attach style guide, be explicit about tone, use purpose-built agent

**Too short**: Specify length, list required elements, ask for elaboration

**Inaccurate**: Use agents with research tools, attach source pages, verify claims
