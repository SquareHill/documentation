## Overview

AI content generation transforms how you create documentation in Radical Whale. Instead of starting with a blank page, you can use AI agents to draft, enhance, and refine content while maintaining your style and standards.

The AI integration is built directly into the page editor through slash commands, making it seamlessly available whenever you're writing.

## Getting Started

### The AI Slash Command

Type `/` at the beginning of any line to see available commands:

## The AI Prompt Interface

### Agent Selection

Choose which AI agent generates your content:

**Consider**:

- **Agent Purpose**: Use agents designed for content creation
- **Model Capabilities**: GPT-4o for complex writing, Claude for analysis
- **Tools Available**: Agents with research tools for fact-based content
- **Cost vs Quality**: Balance model sophistication with usage costs

**Tips**:

- Create specialized content agents for different purposes
- Configure agents with appropriate system prompts
- Use the same agent for consistency within a project
- Test different agents to find what works best

### Page Context Selector

Attach reference pages to inform AI generation:

**How to Use**:

1. Click "Attach pages" in the AI prompt
2. Search or browse available pages
3. Select one or more pages
4. Selected pages shown as badges
5. AI receives full page content as context

**When to Use**:

- Following templates or formats
- Maintaining consistent style
- Referencing existing content
- Building on previous work

**Best Practices**:

- Attach relevant pages only
- 2-3 pages for most tasks
- More pages for complex synthesis
- Update selection based on needs

### Prompt Writing

The prompt tells AI what to generate:

**Effective Prompts**:

✅ **Good**:

```
"Write a technical blog post explaining our new API rate limiting feature.
Target audience is developers. Include code examples. Aim for 800-1000 words."
```

✅ **Better**:

```
"Write a developer-focused blog post about our new API rate limiting feature.
Explain: why we built it, how it works, and how to implement it. Include
example code in Python and JavaScript. Maintain a helpful, educational tone.
Approximately 1000 words with 3-4 main sections."
```

❌ **Too Vague**:

```
"Write something about the API"
```

**Prompt Components**:

1. **Content Type**: Blog post, documentation, analysis, etc.
2. **Topic**: What to write about
3. **Audience**: Who will read this
4. **Key Points**: What must be included
5. **Style/Tone**: How to write it
6. **Length**: How much to write
7. **Format**: Structure and organization

## Generation Process

### Regeneration

Not happy with results? Try again:

**Adjust and Retry**:

1. Select and delete generated content
2. Type `/ai` again
3. Refine your prompt based on what didn't work
4. Try different page context
5. Consider different agent
6. Generate again with improvements

**Iterative Refinement**:

- Generate initial draft
- Review and identify gaps
- Save as page
- Use as context with refinement prompt
- Generate improved version

### Combining AI and Manual Writing

Best approach: combine both

**AI for**:

- Initial drafts and outlines
- Research and data gathering
- Standard sections and boilerplate
- Expanding on key points
- Alternative phrasings

**Manual for**:

- Personal insights and experiences
- Specific examples from your work
- Fine-tuning tone and style
- Final polish and refinement
- Critical review and fact-checking

## Common Generation Patterns

### 1. Drafting from Scratch

**Scenario**: Starting a new document

**Approach**:

```
Prompt: "Write a comprehensive guide to setting up our development
environment. Include: prerequisites, installation steps, configuration,
and common troubleshooting. Target audience is new developers joining
our team."

Result: Complete first draft to review and refine
```

### 2. Expanding Outline

**Scenario**: You have structure, need content

**Approach**:

```
Manual: Write section headings and bullet points
Then: "Expand this outline into full paragraphs. Maintain the structure
but add detailed explanations, examples, and clear transitions between
sections."

Result: Fleshed-out content from your structure
```

### 3. Rewriting with Style

**Scenario**: Content exists but needs different tone

**Approach**:

```
Attached: "Brand Voice Guide"
Prompt: "Rewrite the following section in our brand voice. Make it more
conversational and engaging while keeping all key information:
[paste content]"

Result: Same information, different style
```

### 4. Technical Documentation

**Scenario**: Need to document technical features

**Approach**:

```
Attached: "API Documentation Template"
Prompt: "Document our new webhook system following our API documentation
template. Include: overview, authentication, payload format, example
code in 3 languages, and error handling."

Result: Structured technical documentation
```

### 5. Summarization

**Scenario**: Distill longer content

**Approach**:

```
Attached: "Detailed Research Report"
Prompt: "Create an executive summary of this research report. Focus on
key findings, implications, and recommendations. Keep under 500 words."

Result: Concise summary of main points
```

### 6. Comparative Analysis

**Scenario**: Compare multiple items

**Approach**:

```
Attached: "Option A Details", "Option B Details"
Prompt: "Create a comparison analysis of these two options. Organize by:
features, costs, implementation complexity, and maintenance. Include a
recommendation based on our enterprise use case."

Result: Structured comparison with recommendation
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Stage Generation

Break complex content into stages:

**Stage 1: Structure**

```
Prompt: "Create a detailed outline for a whitepaper about AI in healthcare.
Include main sections, key points, and logical flow."
```

**Stage 2: Content**

```
For each section:
Prompt: "Write the [Section Name] section based on this outline: [outline].
Aim for 400-500 words with concrete examples."
```

**Stage 3: Polish**

```
Prompt: "Review this complete draft for: clarity, flow, consistency, and
impact. Suggest improvements and refined wording."
```

### Context Layering

Use multiple reference pages strategically:

**Foundation**

```
Attached: "Writing Style Guide"
Base prompt with style expectations
```

**Add Specifics**

```
Attached: "Writing Style Guide", "Technical Writing Standards"
Technical content with appropriate style
```

**Final Context**

```
Attached: "Writing Style Guide", "Technical Writing Standards",
          "Example Best Practices Doc"
Fully informed generation with style, standards, and examples
```

### Prompt Chaining

Chain prompts for complex tasks:

**Chain 1: Research**

```
Attached: Agent with research tools
Prompt: "Research the latest trends in [topic]. Provide key findings with sources."
```

**Chain 2: Analysis**

```
Attached: Research findings from Chain 1
Prompt: "Analyze these findings. Identify patterns, implications, and opportunities."
```

**Chain 3: Recommendations**

```
Attached: Research + Analysis
Prompt: "Based on this research and analysis, provide strategic recommendations
for our team."
```

## Best Practices
