## Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Tools enable your agents to connect to external MCP servers and automatically discover available tools. Instead of manually configuring each tool, you simply point to an MCP server URL, and all its tools become instantly available to your agents.

## Why Use MCP Tools?

### Dynamic Tool Discovery

- **Automatic**: Tools are discovered when agents run—no manual configuration needed
- **Up-to-date**: Always uses the latest tools and schemas from the server
- **Scalable**: One MCP server can provide dozens of tools instantly

### Popular MCP Servers

MCP is a growing ecosystem with servers for common use cases:

### Key Benefits

- **No Schema Maintenance**: Server updates its tools automatically
- **Consistent Interface**: Standard MCP protocol across all servers
- **Easy Integration**: Connect once, get multiple tools
- **Community Ecosystem**: Growing library of public MCP servers

## Creating an MCP Server Tool

### Step 1: Navigate to Tools

1. Click **Tools** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Create Tool** button
3. Select **MCP Server** as the tool type

### Step 2: Configure Server Connection

#### Server Name

Give your MCP server a descriptive name:

- **Good**: "Tavily Web Search", "Company GitHub Tools"
- **Avoid**: "MCP Server 1", "Test"

#### Description

Explain what tools this server provides:

```
Provides web search and research tools via Tavily's MCP server.
Includes web_search, news_search, and research capabilities.
```

#### Server URL

Enter the MCP server endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Production (HTTPS)
https://mcp.tavily.com
```

```bash Development (HTTP)
http://localhost:3000
```

```bash WebSocket
wss://mcp.example.com
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Always use HTTPS (`https://`) or secure WebSocket (`wss://`) URLs in production for security.
</Note>

### Step 3: Test Connection

Before saving, test the connection:

1. Click **Test Connection** button
2. The system will connect to the MCP server
3. You'll see a list of discovered tools
4. Verify the tools match your expectations

### Step 4: Save and Assign

1. Click **Create Tool** to save the configuration
2. Navigate to your agent
3. In the **Tools** section, select your new MCP server tool
4. Save the agent configuration

## Using MCP Tools with Agents

Once you've created an MCP server tool and assigned it to an agent:

1. **Automatic Discovery**: The agent will automatically discover all tools from the server when it runs
2. **Multiple Tools**: A single MCP server often provides multiple related tools
3. **Dynamic Usage**: The agent chooses which tools to use based on the task

### Example: Web Search Agent

After connecting a Tavily Search MCP server to your agent:

- Agent automatically gets access to `web_search`, `news_search`, and other search tools
- No need to configure each tool individually
- Agent knows how to use each tool from the server's schemas

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Names

<CodeGroup>
```json Good
{
  "name": "Tavily Web Search Tools",
  "description": "Provides web search, news search, and research capabilities"
}
```

```json Avoid
{
  "name": "MCP Server 1",
  "description": "Tools"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Test Before Production

1. Create a test agent with only the MCP tool
2. Run a simple job to verify connection
3. Check logs for successful tool discovery
4. Test each discovered tool individually

### 3. Monitor Performance

Check your agent execution logs to verify:

- ✅ Successful connection to MCP server
- ✅ Tools discovered correctly
- ❌ Any connection errors or timeouts

### 4. Secure Your Connections

<Warning>
  Only use HTTP URLs (`http://`) for local development. Always use HTTPS (`https://`) in production environments.
</Warning>

## Multiple MCP Servers

You can assign multiple MCP servers to a single agent to give it access to a wide variety of tools:

**Example: Research Assistant Agent**
- Tavily Web Search (MCP) - for web research
- GitHub Tools (MCP) - for repository information
- Company API (API Tool) - for internal data

All tools from all sources work together seamlessly.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

**Error**: `"Failed to connect to MCP server"`

**Solutions**:
- Verify the server URL is correct and accessible
- Check that your worker can reach the server (firewalls, network)
- Ensure you're using the correct protocol (`https://` or `wss://`)
- Test the URL in a browser or with `curl`

### No Tools Discovered

**Error**: `"No tools discovered from MCP server"`

**Solutions**:
- Confirm the MCP server implements `tools/list` correctly
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify the server is running and healthy
- Test with a different MCP client to isolate the issue

### Tool Execution Errors

**Error**: `"MCP tool error: ..."`

**Solutions**:
- Check that the agent is passing correct parameters
- Verify the tool's input schema matches what the agent provides
- Review MCP server logs for specific error messages
- Test the tool directly via the MCP protocol

### DNS or Network Issues

**Error**: `"dial tcp: lookup mcp.example.com: no such host"`

**Solutions**:
- Verify the domain resolves correctly (`nslookup mcp.example.com`)
- Check firewall rules allow outbound connections
- Ensure the server is publicly accessible
- Try accessing from the same network as your worker

## Finding MCP Servers

### Official MCP Servers

Browse the official Model Context Protocol server repository:
- [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

### Popular Community Servers

Many companies and developers are publishing MCP servers:
- Search GitHub for "mcp-server"
- Check the MCP documentation for featured servers
- Look for MCP integrations from your favorite tools and services
